**Trustified is a platform to issue forgery-proof digital certificates and badges on Blockchain.**

# Why Trustified?

**The traditional way of issuing Physical and Digital Certificates consists of the risk of permanent availability and document forgery issues.**

**Trustified provides**:

Availability: All the data will be stored on decentralized storage of the Filecoin network.

Forgery Proof: Each certificate and badge will be an NFT on the FVM blockchain.

Ownership: Ensures true ownership of digital badges and certificates.
